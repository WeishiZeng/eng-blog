Process Limits on Mac: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT3854


Why too many threads is a problem?
1. threads/processes share memory resources. Good practice to limit number of threads per process.
2. Context switching is expensive.
3. It doesn't help. Competing for the same resources.


Threaded Server vs. Evented Server
Threaded Server: One thread to handle one request from start to end.
Evented Server: A event is dispatched and some handler will pick it up later.

CPU intensive task: non of these models scale. Threaded server is better. everyone have a equal chance running their hashcode.
IO intensive task: then evented server scales better.

For the purpose of scheduling, a thread is in one of 3 states:
Running
Ready: waiting for CPU time
Blocked: waiting for some other event (disk I/O, incoming network packet, etc.)

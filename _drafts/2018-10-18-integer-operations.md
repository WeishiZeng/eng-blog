rounding:
1. rounding towards 0    1/2 = 0; -1 / 2 = 0
2. rounding up: 1/2 = 1; -1 / 2 = 0
3. rounding down: 1 / 2 = 0; -1/2 = -1


java, c++ :  rounding towards 0
python: rounding down


modulo:
allow negative result: -2 % 3 = -2
no negative result: -2 % 3 = 1;

java, c++: allow negative result
python: no negative result

<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Today, when I was trying to generate a series of random number in java code to be an database primary key, I was thinking of<br />System.currentTimeMillis()<br /><br />However, it doesn't work as the granularity is actually dependent on the OS. It might be 10 times miliseconds. Anyway, in my for loop it some times give duplicate value.<br /><br /><br />Also, I find an interesting utility in Eclipse. Let's talk about jpage next time.</div>

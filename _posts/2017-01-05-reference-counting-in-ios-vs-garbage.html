<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) vs. Tracing Garbage Collection (GC)<br /><br />http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/285333/how-does-garbage-collection-compare-to-reference-counting<br /><br />http://www.cubrid.org/blog/dev-platform/understanding-java-garbage-collection/<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; clear: both; color: #242729; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Automatic Reference counting or ARC, is a form of garbage collection in which objects are deallocated once there are no more references to them, i.e. no other variable refers to the object in particular. Each object, under ARC, contains a reference counter, stored as an extra field in memory, which is incremented every time you set a variable to that object (i.e. a new reference to the object is created), and is decremented every time you set a reference to the object to nil/null, or a reference goes out of scope (i.e. it is deleted when the stack unwinds), once the reference counter goes down to zero, the object takes care of deleting itself, calling the destructor and freeing the allocated memory. This approach has a significant weakness, as we shall see below.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; clear: both; color: #242729; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">"There's no need to worry about memory management because it's all taken care of for you by reference counting," that's actually a misconception you still do need to take care to avoid certain conditions, namely circular references, in order for ARC to function correctly. A circular reference is when an object A holds a strong reference to an object B, which itself holds a strong reference to the same object A, in this situation neither object is going to be deallocated because in order for A to be deallocated its reference counter must be decremented to zero, but at least one of those references is object B, for object B to be deallocated, its reference counter must also be decremented to 0, but at least one of those references is object A, can you see the problem? ARC solves this by allowing the programmer to give compiler hints about how different object references should be treated, there are two types of references: strong references and weak references. Strong references are, as I mentioned above, a type of reference which prolongs the life of the referenced object (increments its reference counter), weak references are a type of reference which does not prolong the life of an object (that is, it does not increment the object's reference counter), but that would mean the referenced object could get deallocated and you'd would be left with an invalid reference pointing to junk memory. In order for this situation to be avoided, the weak reference is set to a safe value (e.g. nil in Objective-C) once the object is deallocated, thus the object has an extra responsibility of keeping track of all weak references and setting them to a safe value once it deletes itself. Weak references are usually used in a child-parent object relation, the parent holds a strong reference to all it's child objects, whereas the child objects hold a weak reference to the parent, the rationale being that in most cases if you no longer care about the parent object, you most likely no longer care about the child objects either.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; clear: both; color: #242729; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Tracing garbage collection (i.e. what is most often referred to as simply garbage collection) involves keeping a list of all root objects (i.e. those stored in global variables, the local variables of the main procedure, etc) and tracing which objects are reachable (marking each object encountered) from those root objects. Once the garbage collector has gone through all the objects referenced by the root objects, the GC now goes through every allocated object, if it is marked as reachable it stays in memory, if it is not marked as reachable it is deallocated, this is known as the mark-and-sweep algorithm. This has the advantage of not suffering from the circular reference problem as: if neither the mutually referenced object A and object B are referenced by any other object reachable from the root objects, neither object A nor object B are marked as reachable and are both deallocated. Tracing garbage collectors run in certain intervals pausing all threads, which can lead to inconsistent performance (sporadic pauses). The algorithm described here is a very basic description, modern GC's are usually much more advanced using an object generation system, tri-color sets etc, and also perform other tasks such as defragmentation of the program's memory space by moving the objects to a contiguous storage space, this is the reason why GC'ed languages such as C# and Java do not allow pointers. One significant weakness of tracing garbage collectors is that class destructors are no longer deterministic, that is the programmer cannot tell when an object is going to be garbage collected in-fact GC'ed languages do not even allow the programmer to specify a class destructor, thus classes can no longer be used to encapsulate the management of resources such as file handles, database connections, etc. The responsibility is left on the programmer to close open files, database connections manually, hence why languages such as Java have a finally keyword (in the try,catch block) to make sure the cleanup code is always executed before the stack unwinds, whereas in C++ (no GC) such resources are handled by a wrapper object (allocated on the stack) which acquires the resource in the constructor and releases it in the destructor, which is always called as the object is removed from the stack.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; clear: both; color: #242729; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">As for performance, both have performance penalties. Automatic reference counting delivers a more consistent performance, no pauses, but slows down your application as a whole as every assignment of an object to a variable, every deallocation of an object, etc, will need an associated incrementation/decrementation of the reference counter, and taking care of reassigning the weak references and calling each destructor of each object being deallocated. GC does not have the performance penalty of ARC when dealing with object references; however, it incurs pauses while it is collecting garbage (rendering unusable for real-time processing systems) and requires a large memory space in order for it to function effectively such that it is not forced to run, thus pausing execution, too often.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; clear: both; color: #242729; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">As you can see both have their own advantages and disadvantages, there is no clear cut ARC is better or GC is better, both are compromises.</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; clear: both; color: #242729; font-family: Arial, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"><strong style="border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">PS:</strong>&nbsp;ARC also becomes problematic when objects are shared across multiple threads requiring atomic incrementation/decrementation of the reference counter, which itself presents a whole new array of complexities and problems. This should answer your question as to "why would anyone use garbage collection".</div></div>
